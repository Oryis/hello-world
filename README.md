Hello All!

And so we begin a new adventure! After years of historical study and advocacy work, I am finally taking a step and pursuing a long-time interest and goal of my own.
I have worked as a mass atrocity prevention expert and advocate for a few years and have decided to take a step back to watch and help create things instead of learning more about how people destroy. Kind of heavy, but it keeps me focused on these new goals!
